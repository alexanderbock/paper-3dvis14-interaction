Other points:
- in voice control, a system that can automatically distinguish between commands intended for the computer and normal speech intended for the audience would be really useful here.

It could have been interesting to discuss a few combinations of various interaction technique and scenario. (What happens if I use a iPhone for presenting in an auditorium?) It also would have been good to list more possible contexts within each scenario. (In "Presentations in an Auditorium", only the Dome is covered. What if one is using a CAVE-like or other environment?)

Low-level points:
o The use of commas should be revisited, for example by getting help from a a native/fluent speaker of English or by consulting style guide.
o Please use proper quotation marks (66quoted text99), single quotation marks (6quoted text9), and apostrophes (Smith9s paper).
