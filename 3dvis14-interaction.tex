\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

Using an object such as a mouse, can be useful both in 2D and 3D movements but often offer unnatural ways of exploring the scientific data, as the hands or not directly interacting with the visualization of the data.

\section{Gestures}

Discuss gesture vs postures for kinect, and gesture available for both touch and kinect.

\section{Scenario: Workstation}

Touch good, reaching to the data.

Clipping, 2D to 3D representation of region.

Rotation, gripping points...



\section{Scenario: Presentation}

Dome, movement, viewers benefit to see how presenter interacts with the data.
