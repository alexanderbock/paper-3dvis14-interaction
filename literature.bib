This paper presents an upto- date and comprehensive review of the state of the art of non-immersive interaction techniques for Navigation, Selection & Manipulation, and System Control, including a basic introduction to the topic, the challenges, and an examination of a number of popular approaches. We hope that this survey can aid both researchers and developers of interactive 3D applications in having a clearer overview of the topic and in particular can be useful for practitioners and researchers that are new to the field of interactive 3D graphics.}

In scientific visualization we saw use cases of quasi-postures, suggesting that they are one way to re-use the same input space in order to facilitate several means of exploration.}},

Gesture controlled systems seem to be promising, since they allow for a touch-free control of computer systems. In a previous publication we presented a system which allows the control of the open source Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) OsiriX by means of gesture and voice commands. In order to overcome the limitations of this system, we developed a plug-in for OsiriX that allows for gesture control of the DICOM viewer of OsiriX with finger gestures. {\^A}{\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.}
